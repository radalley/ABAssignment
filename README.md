# Deployment of a Python (Flask) web app to Azure App Service - Sample Application for Anheuser-Busch

This is the sample Python Flask application utilizing GitHubActions to deploy through Azure. Created for coding assessment for Anheuser-Busch Interview process 

Below are the instructions for the assessment:

Use GitHub Actions to create a CD process that can deploy an application to Azure.
- Use any language you desire. In this case, I chose Python with Flask
- Deploy to any resource in Azure (static web app, app service, AKS, etc). In this case, I chose App Service
- Use the Free subscription in Azure if you donâ€™t have one already. Azure subscription set up for an account
- Store the code in GitHub and make the repository Public. Code has been stored and made public

Definition of Done: Requirement Checklist
- Sample App cloned and necessary files committed into the repository
- .Yaml file created for use by actions. On commit deploys to Azure
- Secrets created and Resource Groups made in Azure
- Commits in GitHub deploy directly to Azure
- App displays changes on https://dalleydevapp.azurewebsites.net/
